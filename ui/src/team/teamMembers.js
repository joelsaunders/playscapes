        "short-bio": "Jo is a keen critical thinker who enjoys the messy process of uncovering assumptions and possibilities. Even though it is often uncomfortable, she likes to challenge the way she has been taught things ‘should’ be. Over the past four years she has worked at RISE Beyond, a leadership consultancy. An experience that was new and uncomfortable for her, but which she has learnt a lot from, the skill of drawing people’s attention to what is going on in the room (and sometimes even how it relates to what is not in the room!) She lives in London.",

Rather than a course on delivering speeches, she joined Claire Schrader’s Finding Your Voice and I Don’t Know What to Say course. She is joining Claire’s facilitator training in early 2021 for therapists, dramatherapists, and other people working with groups. \n \n Jo was then introduced to The Nursery as a place where improvisation wasn’t just a tool to make people laugh (though she loves doing that) but as a beautiful way to play together which can sometimes be poignant and sad. There she has done beginner classes, and other courses in performance confidence, types of scenes, and characters."

He draws on a rich background in critical education, Nonviolent Communication, organisational consulting, developmental psychology, complexity thinking, and improvisational theatre to participate in conversations with people in organisation and communities about taking their experience of working and living together more seriously.
