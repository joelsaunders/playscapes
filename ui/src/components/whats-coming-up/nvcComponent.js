                    Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a transformative approach to building greater
                    compassion and connection with ourselves and others, and a highly effective tool
                    for working with difference, collaborating, and making decisions more
                    effectively and efficiently. NVC was created by Marshall B. Rosenberg
                    (1934-2015), an American psychologist who studied with Carl Rogers and spent
                    more than four decades travelling the world teaching nonviolence and supporting
                    peaceful conflict resolution. NVC is now taught around the world by more than
                    600 certified trainers and many other enthusiastic and skilful practitioners.
